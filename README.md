# Registration Form🌈

Hey there,👋🏾

This file has the HTML for creating a Registration Form with freeCodeCamp. Like registering for a camp but with a twist of course. This excercise  is to give basic knowledge on how to go about the important aspects of an HTML file. 
I really hope this helps and don't forget to check out freecodecamp for lessons on your coding journey!

Wishing you all the best!✨
